        name: 'Ryman Auditorium',
        location: 'Downtown',
        description: "We begin with the first name in Nashville music, the venue that started it all. It was the Ryman -- “the Mother Church of Country Music” -- that first started attracting names like Hank Williams, Dolly Parton, and George Jones, securing Nashville’s status as the American center of country music. The Ryman remains a country music mecca, but as one of the city’s most dazzling concert-going experiences, has also hosted everyone from the Foo Fighters to Janelle Monae. Even if you don’t make it to a concert, it’s at least worth taking the time for a brief tour."

      name: 'Grand Ole Opry',
      location: 'Music Row',
      description: "A venue that needs no introduction, the Opry is actually a bit of a haul from downtown Nashville, but it’s worth the trip if only to see what all the fuss is about. It’s a country music fan’s dream and also attracts plenty of non-country artists who are nevertheless drawn by the sheer allure of the place. Once you’re inside, you really can’t deny that there’s something magical about the place."

        name: 'Mercy Lounge',
        location: 'Downtown',
        description: "Mercy is actually two different venues. Cannery Ballroom is the larger of the two, an airy, open auditorium with a bar that stretches nearly its full length. And then there’s its little sister, the High Watt, which tends to host more regional acts in a more intimate setting. Both are well-loved by locals for solid vibes, a killer view, and some of the strongest cocktails money can buy. Give yourself a little extra time to explore the surrounding complex, where you can find the city’s hippest hair salon, Parlour & Juke."

        location: 'Green Hills',
        description: "A beloved institution, known for catering both to up-and-coming songwriters and legendary country music vets, the Bluebird navigates the nifty trick of having a ton of appeal for locals, out-of-town tourists and even A-list stars who have been known to take the stage on a whim. Whether you love country music, are looking for a uniquely Nashville experience, or just have a few hours to kill before your dinner reservation, you can’t beat the Bluebird."

        name: 'The Blue Room',
        location: 'Berry Hill',
        description: "If you want a great audio experience, you can’t ask for better than a room designed by Jack White, one of the most obsessive audiophiles of his generation. The Blue Room is a venue in White’s Third Man Records and just like all things Jack White, it pays close attention to the little details. From an interior perfectly calibrated for beautiful sonics (an experience harder to find in Nashville than you might think) to aesthetics that rigorously adhere to Third Man’s unique color palette, the Blue Room is a small venue well worth snagging a ticket to."

        name: 'Exit/Inn',
        location: 'Elliston Place',
        description: "Few Nashville venues have embraced rock and roll like Exit/In, which has more of a punk rock vibe in its women’s room than the rest of Music City combined. Take a gander at Exit/In’s meticulous list of all the acts that have played there over the years and your head will start spinning at how many legacies have taken the stage. There’s not a bad seat in the house, but don’t miss the balcony, which is definitely the best seat in the house."
